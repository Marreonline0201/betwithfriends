I want to make an website that a couple or friends can bet in a game. They will choose the game and this website only will help the user to show what they bet and how many games each users won
1. Log in/Sign in
- Also use google, meta, x, etc
- Should be able to change password

2. Main function
- Add/Delete user
- Add/Delete bet
- Add/Delete wins

I want the UI to be clean and easy to use. Also please tell me how the website works. I am currently in a learning stage. Using Node.js and React.js would be a good start.
